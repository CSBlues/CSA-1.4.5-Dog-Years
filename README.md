# CSA-1.4.5-Dog-Years

Complete this coding challenge by:
- Reading input in from the [Scanner](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp) class. The `nextInt()` function will be useful to get integer input from the command line.
- Implement your algorithms to calculate your age and your dog's age (7 times a human's age).
- Print out your answers for your age and your dog's age on one line. Your final output should look something like this: 
`Human: 37 Dog: 8. Line 33`
